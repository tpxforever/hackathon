# Chronos

Chronos is a web application that enables users to store and share memories through a personalized "capsule" feature. Users can create capsules to store images, text, videos, and share them with friends while customizing the capsule's themes, visibility, and duration. Chronos offers a premium version with additional features such as increased upload limits and extended duration options.

- **Dot Animation**: A circle animation is triggered on the landing page to transition to the dashboard.
